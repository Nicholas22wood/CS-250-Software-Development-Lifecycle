How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Having the ability to interpret users needs accurately is a great tool to have, it lets you correctly determine what features and functions are needed in the system. The user stories are a great way to communciate the users ideas to the development team as it explains what the team must develop for the user to be satisfied. The great thing about an agile process is that the product owner, creater of the user stories, is able to interact with the user and get direct information from them as well as ask clarifying questions so they can have an accurate representation. Interpretting user stories can be difficult but it is about understanding exactly what the user wants and translating that into features and functions in a program.
