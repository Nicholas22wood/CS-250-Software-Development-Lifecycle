1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Having the ability to interpret users’ needs accurately is a great tool to have, it lets you correctly determine what features and functions are needed in the system. The user stories are a great way to communicate the user’s ideas to the development team as it explains what the team must develop for the user to be satisfied. The great thing about an agile process is that the product owner, creator of the user stories, is able to interact with the user and get direct information from them as well as ask clarifying questions so they can have an accurate representation. Interpreting user stories can be difficult but it is about understanding exactly what the user wants and translating that into features and functions in a program.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs it is always good to start with a layout of the entire project. I would approach a project by first getting the required information from the Owner who is wanting to develop a system. This would include getting the user stories and creating a backlog and getting all the features and functions as well as getting the requirements for the entire system. With this I could determine what would be a good starting off point and how to create the system the Owner wanted. The scrum agile process is a great method that allows the development of the system with the adaption of changes. I believe that the agile process and the scrums will be consistently used in the industry today.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

When it comes to being a good team member I think the most important this is communication. Communication is the one thing that needs to be included in every project and it leads to great products. Communication is more than just talking it is also about the documentation side of it and accurately documenting the system. Being a good team member includes this as well as taking responsibility for their product as well as speaking up when they have an idea or an issue with a feature. Having this type of mindset of communicating often and taking responsibility of one’s own work leads to a great team member.
